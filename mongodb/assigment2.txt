//Atlanta Population//

1. use db.zipcodes.find() to filter results to only the results where city is ATLANTA 
and state is GA.
ans-1. db.zipcodes.find({“city”: “ATLANTA”, “state”: “GA”})

2. use db.zipcodes.aggregate with $match to do the same as above
ans-2.	 db.zipcodes.aggregate([{$match: {“city”: “ATLANTA”, “state”: “GA”}}]).

3. use $group to count the number of zip codes in Atlanta.
ans-3 db.zipcodes.aggregate([{$match: {"city": "ATLANTA"}}, {$group:{_id:"$city", count:{$sum: 1}}}])

4. use $group to find the total population in Atlanta
ans4. db.zipcodes.aggregate([{$match: {"city": "ATLANTA"}}, {$group: {_id: "$city", totalPop: {$sum: "$pop"}}}])

                                     
Populations By State
1. use aggregate to calculate the total population for each state
ans-db.zipcodes.aggregate([{$group: {_id: "$state", totalPop: {$sum: "$pop"}}}])

2. sort the results by population, highest first
ans- db.zipcodes.aggregate([{$sort:{"pop": -1}}]).

3. limit the results to just the first 3 results. What are the top 3 states in 
population?
ans-3.	 db.zipcodes.aggregate([{$sort:{"pop": -1}},{$limit: 3}]).




//Populations by City//

1. use aggregate to calculate the total population for each city (you have to use 
city/state combination). You can use a combination for the _id of the $group: { 
city: '$city', state: '$state' }
ans-1.	db.zipcodes.aggregate([{$group: {_id: {state: "$state", city: "$city"}, pop: {$sum: "$pop"}}}])

2. sort the results by population, highest first
ans-2.	db.zipcodes.aggregate([{ $group: {_id: {state: "$state", city: "$city"}, pop: {$sum: "$pop"}}}, {$sort: { pop: -1}}])	

3. limit the results to just the first 3 results. What are the top 3 cities in 
population?
ans-db.zipcodes.aggregate([{$group: {_id: {state: "$state", city: "$city"}, pop: {$sum: "$pop"}}}, {$sort: { pop: -1}}, {$limit: 3}])

4. What are the top 3 cities in population in Texas?
ans-db.zipcodes.aggregate([{$match: {"state" : "TXS"}}, {$group: {_id: {state: "$state", city: "$city"}, pop: {$sum:"$pop"}}}, {$sort: {pop: -1}}, {$limit: 3}]).


//Bonus//

1. Write a query to get the average city population for each state.
ans- db.zipcodes.aggregate( [{ $group: { _id: { state: "$state", city: "$city" }, pop: { $sum: "$pop"}}},{ $group: { _id: "$_id.state", avgCityPop: { $avg: "$pop"}}}]).

2. What are the top 3 states in terms of average city population
ans-db.zipcodes.aggregate( [{ $group: {_id: {state: "$state", city: "$city"}, pop: {$sum: "$pop"}}},{$group: {_id: "$_id.state", avgCityPop: { $avg: "$pop"}}}, {$sort: {avgCityPop: -1}}, {$limit:3}] )
